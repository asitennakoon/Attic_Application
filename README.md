# Attic - Software Development Group Project by Terabyte 💺🛋️🛏️

Attic is a platform that facilitates designing and furnishing living rooms utilizing augmented reality and data science, especially image processing and deep learning.

## Description

Attic has in its database 3D models of furniture items which a user can map onto their living room with the use of AR technology. Users can choose a furniture type they 
want and adjust the dimensions of the 3D model of the furniture item as they prefer. Although the user selects the furniture type, the suitable style for the furniture 
is determined by Attic itself by analysing the camera view with the help of a deep learning model built using a convolutional neural network.
